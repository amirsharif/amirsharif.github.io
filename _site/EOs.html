    A few weeks ago, I read
    <a href="https://twitter.com/_dave__white_">@_Dave__White_</a> and
    <a href="https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX">@SBF_FTX</a>'s
    <a href="https://www.paradigm.xyz/2021/05/everlasting-options/">paper</a> on
    everlasting options for the first time. <br /><br />
    A few things surprised me and I became interested in trying to ‘warp’ them
    with different compositional assumptions. I jotted down some notes and
    tweeted some takeaways <a href="">here [LINK TO TWEETS ONCE YOU TWEET]</a>.

  <br />
  <h2>QUESTIONS</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    I was curious to better understand some of the dynamics of EOs.
    Specifically: <br /><br />
    1 – How does the mark, funding fee, and funding fee volatility of an EO
    change as a function of FF (funding frequency)?
    <br /><br />
    2 – What are the trade-offs of choosing a lower vs. higher FF?
    <br /><br />
    3 – What happens if we try to manipulate the composition of an EO's
    equivalent portfolio by replacing the FF-defined weighting term with other
    geometric series?
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2>1.a – RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FF AND THE MARK OF AN EO</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    It’s possible to answer these questions just by manipulating the
    Black-Scholes formula\(^1\) but I thought it would be more fun (and more
    digestible) to try to observe these relationships tangibly. So I pulled some
    data on Apple call options and constructed an artificial EO call on Apple at
    a $140 strike.
    <br /><br />
    My colab workbook is
    <a
      href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1L8eq-2N2-Vuxc26DgPpv_tL8gZZ4QheA?usp=sharing"
      >here</a
    >. <br /><br />
    And the underlying data with my janky excel clean up work is
    <a
      href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/172A32b5C3jN0OwQYEc0C4qi2Zj9XX1tI/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100247262631856998407&rtpof=true&sd=true"
      >here</a
    >.
    <a
      href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O0tLtcm-Ti4LmL8Xgh2r73mBTQi6qr3l/view?usp=sharing"
      >This</a
    >
    is the csv export I reference in the colab workbook. (Data is sourced from
    the
    <a href="https://www.cboe.com/delayed_quotes/aapl/quote_table"
      >Chicago Board Options Exchange</a
    >.) <br /><br />
    (Note: I used a $140 strike because it’s the most commonly traded call
    strike for Apple at the moment.)
    <br /><br />
    There’s a small issue with trying to compute an EO using real-world option
    prices – we actually won’t have options to reference for every major
    expiration term in our EO.
    <br /><br />
    How might we then establish an 'equivalent portfolio' to reference for
    pricing our EO? I used the options that were available to derive a best-fit
    curve so I could then infer prices for daily maturities. This allowed me to
    construct an 'equivalent portfolio' with realistic regprices for calls that
    don’t actually exist on CBOE. Real-world options will vary slightly from
    this curve, which creates arbitrage opportunities; at scale, if EOs are
    broadly traded, I imagine they should impact the price of traditional
    options, forcing them to trade along an EO curve like what’s computed below:
  </p>
  <br />
  <div id="img" style="background-color: white">
    <img src="/assets/PLOT1.png" width="67%" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <p class="notes">
    We can see that Apple calls with a $140 strike can be roughly priced
    according to the line:
    <br />
    y = 0.57829 * x^0.55844 + 2.15977
    <br /><br />
    Where y = price of a traditional expiring option that’s x days from
    expiration.
    <br /><br />
    (It’s helpful to note this is a root function, which means it doesn’t have a
    horizontal asymptote. If it did, then we may not need EOs at all. We could
    instead buy an option with an expiration infinitely far out into the future
    and pay a high finite value for it.)
    <br /><br />
    So what’s the impact of this price curve on the mark of our EO?
    <br /><br />
    As FF increases, the composition of options in the equivalent portfolio
    flattens, shifting more of the weight of the EO into the tail.\(^2\)
    <br /><br />
    Since later expirations are more expensive, we should expect the mark of an
    EO to increase as a function of FF.
    <br /><br />
    Calculating the mark of different FFs shows us that our mark indeed
    increases, also following a root function.\(^3\)

  <h2>1.b – RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FF AND THE FUNDING FEE OF AN EO</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    Recall, funding fee = (1/FF)(mark - payoff).
    <br /><br />
    As FF increases, we should see the funding fee decrease due to the term
    1/FF. However, as noted above, we should also expect our mark to increase as
    FF increases.
    <br /><br />
    What’s the net of these two impacts? Since our option price only scales as a
    root function of maturity (scaling more slowly than 1/FF decays), our fee
    ends up dropping as FF grows.
  </p>
  <br />
  <div id="img" style="background-color: white">
    <img src="/assets/PLOT3.png" width="67%" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <p class="notes">
    It’s interesting to consider that as FF increases, the mark paid upfront for
    an EO should increase, but the incremental funding fee required to roll it
    fwd should decrease.
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2>1.c – RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FF AND THE FUNDING FEE VOLATILITY OF AN EO</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    How much should we expect our funding fee to vary from period to period as a
    result of choosing one FF over another?
    <br /><br />
    This is a bit trickier. If there’s no change in the underlying spot, then we
    shouldn’t see any change to our funding fee, so this is really a
    3-dimensional sensitivity analysis of the funding fee relative to the
    underlying spot and potential FFs.
    <br /><br />
    To assess price fluctuations across varying spot prices, I needed to model
    price as a function of spot values. Our real-world dataset sadly doesn’t
    provide historical option prices according to varying spots, so I couldn’t
    derive the relationship with real data. Instead I relied on the
    Merton-adjusted Black-Scholes call formula.
  </p>
  <br />
  <div id="img" style="background-color: white">
    <img src="/assets/PLOT4.png" width="67%" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <p class="notes">
    Tweaking the inputs a bit, I was able to get the Black-Scholes curve sorta
    close to our best-fit curve. Black-Scholes slightly under-prices in the
    near-term and over-prices in the outlying maturities relative to the
    real-world benchmark. There are likely a bunch of flaws in the way I’ve
    implemented Black-Scholes (e.g., using a static risk-free interest rate
    across all maturities lol), but for my purposes this is close enough and
    gives me a way to observe price movements as a function of the spot.
    <br /><br />
    Looking at this Apple call, if the spot shifts 5% above or below our spot
    benchmark today ($142.90), we can see that the price changes most for
    options with near-term expirations and relatively less so for options with
    later expirations.
  </p>
  <br />
  <div id="img" style="background-color: white">
    <img src="/assets/PLOT5_6.png" width="85%" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <p class="notes">
    Conceptually this makes sense: If we think of options as comprising both
    ‘intrinsic value’ (driven by the delta between their strike and spot) and
    ‘time value’ (driven by time to expiration), time value will make up a
    greater % of later expirations’ price and so changes in the intrinsic value
    will have a relatively muted effect on overall price.
    <br /><br />
    If our EO has a higher FF, we should be more exposed to ‘later expirations.'
    As such, the overall mark of our EO is less volatile as spot moves.
    <br /><br />
    What's the net impact on the funding fee? It's easy to calculate funding fee
    as a function of spot, so let’s just do it and see:
  </p>
  <br />
  <div id="img" style="background-color: white">
    <img src="/assets/PLOT7_8.png" width="67%" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <p class="notes">
    Great – so the funding fee is more sensitive at lower FFs.
    <br /><br />
    But something else surprised me in seeing this – the funding fee actually
    goes down as the call moves further into <u>or</u> out of the money. This
    was super weird to me at first and I assumed I’d made a mistake somewhere.
    <br /><br />
    To better understand this, I decided to look at the funding fee of two EOs –
    one set to FF=1 and another with FF=5 – across a range of spots:
  </p>
  <br />
  <div id="img" style="background-color: white">
    <img src="/assets/PLOT9.png" width="60%" />
  </div>
  <br />
  <p class="notes">
    We can see our funding fee is highest right at the threshold of being in the
    money (recall: strike = $140), where our EO mark is maximized but we are
    still expecting a payoff of ~0. It’s interesting to see that as FF increases
    to 5, the peak fee drops dramatically, in this case by ~80%.
    <br /><br />
    The cumulative impact of these dynamics is interesting to consider: For an
    EO that’s close to the money, a lower FF will increase both the funding fee
    and the relative variance of the funding fee period-to-period.
    <br /><br />
    This might create risk for liquidity-challenged longs holding
    deep-in-the-money EO calls. If there's an intermittent drop in the spot,
    they may be forced to lapse on escalating funding fees, causing their
    portfolios to expire. This is a boon for shorts, whose payoff obligations
    decrease in this scenario just as they are on the hook to fund payoffs. As
    can be seen, at lower FFs, a few % shift in the underlying spot can create
    orders of magnitude increases in fees for longs. Super interesting!
    <br /><br />
    Overall, I was really surprised by the cashflow dynamics of EOs – it would
    appear there are a number of ways they could be manipulated by both longs
    and shorts to maximize returns.\(^4\)
  </p>
  <br />
  <h2>2 – WHAT ARE THE TRADE-OFFS OF CHOOSING A LOWER VS. HIGHER FF?</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    Pausing here, I tried to think about practical applications for EOs.
    <br /><br />
    One idea that came to mind: Using an EO to hedge against intermittent
    movements in a soft-pegged stablecoin. I was curious how the liquidation
    crunch that took place in Dai could have been contained if those who held
    Dai as collateral could have purchased a Dai-based EO ‘put.’ The funding fee
    effectively becomes an insurance premium paid by longs to shorts to receive
    a $ payoff if/when Dai experiences an intermittent drop relative to $.
    Letting an EO put expire would allow longs to receive payoffs as the
    underlying sinks, helping to cover escalating near-term collateral
    obligations and thereby helping to abate cascading liquidations.
    <br /><br />
    Here, the timeline by which a price fluctuation is expected to cascade
    through the market can be a helpful determinant for the relevant funding
    frequency / funding period assumptions for the EO. I would ideally want to
    use a funding frequency that minimizes my fees and fee volatility, but still
    gives me sufficient near-term payoffs in the case of a downward price
    movement in the underlying. It would be fun to determine the ideal terms
    using historical data from past liquidation crunches.

  <h2>3 – 'WARPING' EOs</h2>
  <p class="notes">
    [EMBED TWEETS ON EVERLASTING OPTIONS HERE]
    <br /><br />
    Overall, what’s the point of these alternative weightings?
    <br /><br />
    As we’ve already observed, altering the composition of an EO has an impact
    on the mark, funding fee, and funding fee volatility rate of an EO.
    <br /><br />
    But I actually think the most interesting consequence of a 'warped' EO is
    that, in the case where a funding fee is not paid, the long position will
    close at a varying pace, meaning that shorts might have more notice of a
    major upcoming funding obligation to longs who are letting their EOs expire.
    This has important implications for shorts and could also have consequences
    for the type and amount of collateral that shorts might have to post.
    <br /><br />
    There's a lot to unpack in the above, but before getting ahead of myself,
    it’s important to mention the underlying flaw with ‘warping’ EOs.
    <br /><br />
    In brief, the funding fee of these EOs becomes disjointed from their mark
    and payoffs. The funding fee becomes equivalent to opening a new position in
    a different portfolio of options at each funding period, required a highly
    fractured pool of short/long positions.
    <br /><br />
    Let’s walk through this in simple steps.
    <br /><br />
    Recall that an EO is designed to expire in regular intervals. In order to
    roll a position forward, a trader who is long has to, effectively, buy more
    options such that they ‘replace’ what’s expiring at each interval.
    <br /><br />
    What happens in the case of a ‘warped’ EO?
    <br /><br />
    Consider a portfolio that’s weighted by the convergent series n/2^(n+1). The
    weight terms of the equivalent portfolio become:
  </p>
  <div id="chart5">
    <!-- classic EO -->
    <script>
      function series_warped(n) {
        terms = [];
        for (i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
          terms.push(((i / 2 ** (i + 1)) * 100).toFixed(2));
        }
        console.log(terms);
        return terms;
      }

      var options = {
        chart: {
          type: "bar",
        },

          },
        },

        series: [
          {
            name: "options (sorted in order of increasing time to expiration)",
            data: series_warped(10),
          },
        ],
        xaxis: {
          categories: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
        },
        yaxis: {
          labels: {
            formatter: function (val, index) {
              return val.toFixed(0) + "%";
            },
          },
        },
      };

      var chart = new ApexCharts(document.querySelector("#chart5"), options);

      chart.render();
    </script>
  </div>
  <p class="notes">
    If we were to try to buy more of the same portfolio, with the intention of
    preserving the composition of the portfolio post-expiration, we would want
    to solve for x in the following function (where x is a multiple of our
    portfolio that we have to buy pre-expiration):
    $$x\left({n\over{2^{n+1}}}\right) = {n\over{2^n}}$$
    <br />
    $$x = {2n-2\over{n}}$$
    <br /><br />
    Note: Here, the term n can't be factored out, which effectively means we
    have to buy a different amount of each term in order to succcessfully roll
    our portfolio fwd.
    <br /><br />
    The amount we’d actually have to buy of each term would be:
    <br /><br />
    $$\left({2n-2\over{n}}\right)\left(n\over{2^{n+1}}\right) -
    \left({n}\over{2^{n+1}}\right)$$
    <br />
    Which reduces to: $${n^2-2n}\over{n2^{n+1}}$$
    <br />
    Phew! Try it out. If we want to make our third term equivalent to our second
    by buying more of the third term, our n=3 and we’d have to buy \(2^{-4}\).
    Does that work? Our third term in our EO has a weight of 3/16. If we buy
    1/16 of it, we end up with 3/16 + 1/16 = 4/16 = 1/4 = the right weight for
    our second term.
    <br /><br />
    We can actually visualize how much of each option we’d have to buy for our
    portfolio to roll fwd successfully – shown below in green:

  <p class="notes">
    As you can see, this ‘green’ portfolio’s composition is different from our
    EO’s composition. Interestingly, this purchase would be akin to buying a
    quarter of our existing EO, but with our date index starting 2 funding
    periods later. If we multiply the terms by 4 and shift the x axis to the
    left by 2, you can see our curves overlapping with each other
    <a href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/mfmxup2sho">here</a> (click on
    the purple curve to visualize it over the red). <br /><br />
    In effect: $${4{(n+2)^2-2(n+2)}\over{(n+2)2^{n+2}}} = {n\over{2^{n+1}}}$$
    <br />
    Which is kind of wild!
    <br /><br />
    But this is also akin to buying another EO altogether. Each funding period,
    we'd need a different portfolio, indexed to another 2 periods later, to
    successfully roll fwd.
    <br /><br />
    This creates some tough issues, notably that there needs to be a new short
    portfolio offered every funding period for a given EO to successfully ‘gross
    up’ positions. There are also added complexities if a long intermittently
    skips funding periods, creating ‘warped’ exposures for both longs and
    shorts. With a constant-rate decaying EO, we can pool all short positions
    for a given strike together and the ‘gross up’ portfolio required to roll
    fwd turns out to be the EO itself, ultimately increasing market liquidity
    around a single instrument.
    <br /><br />
    This issue is even more complicated for series that don’t monotonically
    decay from n=1 to infinity, such as our earlier example of ln(n)/(5(n-5)^2
    +5). The math is really ugly but it’s easy to visualize the mechanics of
    what would have to happen – in this case, because of the hump around the 5th
    term, as longs who want to roll our portfolios fwd we’d actually have to go
    short on a chunk of the fifth term so we’re not overweight post-expiration
    when those options become our fourth term. In essence, we have to open a
    bunch of new long and one notable short position to roll fwd – and our
    funding fee is effectively the delta between these increasingly complicated
    cashflows.
    <br /><br />
    To simplify, if we were to roll a ‘warped’ EO fwd, our funding fee could be
    thought of as (mark2 - (first weight term)*payoff), where mark2 indicates
    the purchase of the “gross up” portfolio for that EO as defined above.
    <br /><br />
    Oof!
    <br /><br />
    But the truth is, since we’re dealing with a derivative of an imaginary
    options portfolio, these ‘warped’ EOs are perfectly valid. They’re just
    challenging to track if you’re trying to do the math on pen and paper and
    they greatly fracture the pooling of short/long positions. That's pretty
    bad, but maybe the most damning criticism of these EOs is that they may have
    no real utility. I’d be very curious if there’s ever a need to hedge by a
    specific count of days into the future vs. holding an EO that is most
    exposed to its next immediate expiration and less so going forward. If there
    is utility, I'd love to hear about relevant cases. If there's such a
    scenario, it may still make sense for specialized shorts to offer these as
    bespoke instruments.

    Outstanding questions: <br /><br />
    In the case where a long lapses on funding payments, how long will shorts
    continue distributing payoffs before their obligations are considered

    <br /><br />
    Does the price of an EO need to have a discount term applied to it to

    We could answer this by taking the partial derivative of the Black-Scholes
    formula corresponding to ∂C/∂t, with C and t defined below. But I find it
    hard to build intuition around the dynamics of the terms at this level given
    the complexity of the Black-Scholes formula.

    In the pricing formula provided in appendix B of the paper, the price of
    each constituent option in the 'equivalent portfolio' is multiplied by a
    term defined by the EO’s ‘funding frequency’ (referred to as FF from here
    on):
    <br />
    $$\left({1\over{FF}}\right)\left({FF\over{FF+1}}\right)^n$$
    <br />
    Where n refers to the index of the option in the equivalent basket. Note:
    the term n follows a 1-based index, so the first option to expire in our
    equivalent portfolio has an index of 1, not 0.
    <br /><br />
    In the case where FF = 1, we get the very clean series \(1\over2^n\). As
    shown in the paper, this results in the following weightings (shown as a
    continuous line):

    What happens if funding is paid twice per day? FF = 2 and our series now
    turns into \(2^{(n-1)}\over{3^n}\). This series starts with the term 1/3 and
    decays by 2/3 for each term:

    There’s an interesting relationship between the FF and our portfolio
    weighting – as our frequency increases, our portfolio becomes more evenly
    weighted. In the limit, we effectively hold an equal and infinitesimally
    small amount of each option in the equivalent portfolio.

    I later learned this curve is sometimes used to describe the ‘time-value’ of
    an option – or alternatively the ‘theta decay’ as an option approaches its
    expiration date. In effect, the change in an option’s value from t = 1 to t
    = 2 is going to be relatively greater than the change from t = 300 to t =
    301 (as observed in the Apple call price curve). This intuitively makes
    sense: In the first instance we’re doubling the amount of time we have for
    our option to realize a payoff, and in the latter we’re adding a measly
    33bps of time to our maturity window.

    EOs are in principle very similar to perps, but since the payoff of an
    option is always ≥$0, we end up with a bunch of interesting asymmetries for
    which there are no corollaries in perps. Three noteworthy considerations:<br />
    - All else being equal, a later-expiring option will always be more
    expensive than a nearer expiration<br />
    - As such, the mark of an EO (which is effectively a weighted average price
    of all future expirations) will always be ≥ the payoff of an equivalent
    traditional option expiring at the EO’s next funding period<br />
    - Therefore, following the funding fee formula of (1/FF)(mark - payoff), we
    can see that the funding fee of an EO never turns negative
    <br /><br />
    This means that longs always have to pay the funding fee to shorts. However,
    longs aren’t obligated to pay the funding fee! They could lapse, in which
    case shorts are obligated to fund payoffs to longs, shifting the direction
    of cash flows as the EO partially expires.
    <br /><br />
    What’s interesting about this relationship is that shorts don’t know until
    the instant of expiration whether they are, in net, receiving or paying
    funds, and longs have to believe in the long-term liquidity of shorts to be
    able to fund incremental payoffs in perpetuity (recognizing that at some
    point, the value of each payoff will be infinitesimal).
    <br /><br />
    If I were long an EO with a high FF, I might expect my counterpart short to
    have to post some collateral proving liquidity N periods out into the
    future. If a short defaults on a payoff, or if the value of the underlying
    shifts dramatically (skyrockets for a call / plummets for a put) such that
    the posted collateral falls below the expected N-period threshold, we might
    expect shorts to face margin calls. If a long also suspects a short to be
    illiquid across the short’s portfolio, the long should be expected to stop
    funding EO payments and force collateral liquidation.

    Scratchpad: <br /><br />
    How does the funding fee mechanism work and how can we derive this funding
    fee term ourselves?
    <br /><br />
    To understand what’s actually happening here, it’s helpful to walk through
    the funding mechanics tangibly as laid out in the paper.
    <br /><br />
    Take the vanilla EO with a FF = 1 (the 1/2^n series).
    <br /><br />
    The sum of this infinite series is 1, which means that in buying this EO, we
    effectively own 1 option broken up into 0.5 of an option expiring today,
    0.25 of an option expiring tomorrow, and so on, as mentioned in the paper.
    <br /><br />
    If we were to buy this EO and just hold it, after the first period, half of
    our ‘equivalent portfolio’ will have expired.
    <br /><br />
    For an option to be *~everlasting~*, after each funding period we would
    ideally expect to own the same nominal volume of options and maintain the
    same portfolio composition, we’d just want it dated one period into the
    future.
    <br /><br />
    The paper does a great job of walking through this mechanic so I’ll try to
    avoid being redundant, but in effect, if we’re long an EO, we can purchase
    more of the same EO just a moment before an expiration period and thereby
    ensure that our nominal position volume and portfolio composition don’t
    change. Because the expirations result in a payoff, we actually end up
    having to pay just the difference between the mark of the EO and the value
    of its next immediate payoff.
    <br /><br />
    When FF=1, we just double our position in the EO right before an expiration
    and we end up realizing the payoff equivalent to owning a conventional
    option set to expire at that moment.
    <br /><br />
    Note: I didn't have to close any positions to roll fwd. In effect, the EO
    partially closes on its own.
    <br /><br />
    What happens to this funding fee if our funding frequency increases?
    <br /><br />
    To answer this question, it’s first helpful to understand how much we have
    to gross up each portfolio in order to successfully roll through expiration
    periods.
    <br /><br />
    Grossing up the portfolio effectively means multiplying all of our positions
    by an amount X such that our weights for positions (n+1) equal weights for
    position n. For example, for our vanilla EO of 1/2^n, we are trying to solve
    for:
    <br />
    $$x\left({1\over{2^{n}}}\right) = {1\over{2^{n-1}}}$$
    <br />
    $$x = 2$$
    <br />
    Generalizing for all EOs:
    <br />
    $$x\left({1\over{FF}}\right)\left({FF\over{FF+1}}\right)^{n} =
    \left({1\over{FF}}\right)\left({FF\over{FF+1}}\right)^{n-1}$$
    <br />
    $$x = {FF+1\over{FF}}$$
    <br /><br />
    Technically since we presumably already own a finite 1 EO already, to gross
    up, we can buy x-1 EOs, which simplifies to \(\left({FF+1}\over{FF}\right) -
    1 = {1\over{FF}}\).
    <br /><br />
    Let’s try this out on an EO with FF = 3. This is what the portfolio looks
    like before our first expiration:
